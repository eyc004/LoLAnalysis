# League of Legends Analysis
## Introduction
League of Legends is a online video game developed by Riot Games. This dataset, composed of 149232 rows and 123 columns, holds match information such as game ID, player names, date, and much more for several leagues in 2022. Using this data, we want to find an answer to the question, "For the LCK CL league, which role typically performs better in the team: Bot Lanes (ADCs) or Mid Lanes?" To answer this question, we want to focus on the kills and deaths columns. These columns describe the number of kills and deaths a specific player had in a specific game. We will be utilizing the kills and deaths columns as a measurement to determine which role performs "better" by calculating their K/D (kill/death) ratio and comparing this ratio. With this analysis, we will be able to determine which roles in the LCK CL are stronger and offer insights to where they might be able to improve in the future.
